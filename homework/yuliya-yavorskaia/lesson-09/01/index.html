          This happened, indeed, to the train in which Mr. Fogg was travelling. About twelve o'clock a troop of ten or
          twelve thousand<br> head of buffalo encumbered the track. The locomotive, slackening its speed, tried to
          clear the way with its cowâ€“catcher; but<br> the mass of animals was too great. The buffaloes marched along
          with a tranquil gait, uttering now and then deafening<br> bellowings. There was no use of interrupting them,
          for, having taken a particular direction, nothing can moderate and change their<br> course; it is a torrent
          of living
          flesh which no dam could contain.

          The travellers gazed on this curious spectacle from the platforms; but Phileas Fogg, who had the most reason
          of all to be in a hurry,<br> remained in his seat, and waited philosophically until it should please the
          buffaloes to get out of the way.<br> Passepartout was furious at the delay they occasioned, and longed to
          discharge his arsenal of revolvers upon them.

          "What a country!" cried he. "Mere cattle stop the trains, and go by in a procession, just as if they were
          not impeding travel! Parbleu! I<br> should like to know if Mr. Fogg foresaw this mishap in his programme!
          And here's an engineer who doesn't dare to run the locomotive<br> into this herd of beasts!"

        <p class="page-main__wise">The engineer did not try to overcome the obstacle, and he was wise.</p>
